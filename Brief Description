File System - C, Dynamic Programming and Data Structures

• Built a CLI application that simulates the Linux file system commands.
• Utilized dynamic memory allocation, dynamic data structures and I/O files in order to shape a process similar to the
Linux command-line file manipulation (pwd, touch, mkdir, rm, rmdir, mv, ls, tree).
